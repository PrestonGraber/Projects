Collin and I met up in person on two occasions and discussed the structure of the algorithim the first time and
procceded to work on the algorithm on the second meet up. We continued to contact eachother VIA online.
I constructed the free trie memory function and printTrie contents function. 
I originally made the addwordoccurance function, but collin was the one the reconstructed the function and made it work, so he 
deserves more credit on that function.
Collin continued to make the index page function and finished the main() function.
